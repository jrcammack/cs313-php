               Hey there everyone! I just wanted to take a moment to tell you about one of my favorite things, 
               which is camping. Camping has always been special to me as it has been a chance to get always
               from the struggles and cares of everyday life. Camping is awesome because it gives you a 
               chance to disconnect from things like technology and work and experience the great outdoors. 
               I have found that being away from everything and able to sit back and relax outside and just
               watch the world around me, is very relaxing and rewarding. You don't have to be an expert to do it,
               just try it out and have fun! Below are some fun facts and information about camping.
